# Simple Kudos

Simple Kudos is very simple JavaScript class which you can use to add kudos buttons to a website.

```
let kudos = new SimpleKudos({
  emoji: "ðŸ˜„", // Any emoji to use as the button.
  id: "12345", // An arbitrary string to use as an ID.
  elementId: "kudos" // The ID of the element to attach to.
});
```

And, that's it!
